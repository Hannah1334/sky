<br><br>
<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
While fairly average in height for a "human" body, she seems rather light weight and frail, at least when wearing clothing. Her bare flesh exposes plenty of hard muscle, and while it's nothing in comparison to those who religiously work their bodies to actively achieve peak physical strength, it's still obviously more than average. Tiny but nicely shaped, with a defined hourglass figure and decent-but-average bust, rear, and thighs, Sky's physical shape is definitely incredibly feminine. Her face is defined by rounded cheeks, which are contrasted by a sharp jaw. Generally oval in shape, it still retains very symmetrical and arguably "pretty" features, with a slightly upturned button nose, full lips, and wide youthful eyes. Her skin is smooth and very pale, while long and strictly straight lavender hair falls over her shoulders. Her eyes are a similar shade of purple, but have an almost chromatic glow to them that makes them seem almost metallic.
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
There's a distinct air about her (Haha!) that seems almost regal. Sky carries herself with incredible grace and dexterity, and while she can come off as cold from a distance, it is unintentional. The ancient spirit of the Air Elemental residing within her and occupying her as her literal "soul" is incredibly naive and almost innocent, knowing nothing except the traditions and rituals of its home. She can be very blunt, direct, and unaware of the feelings of those around her. Sky is rarely intentionally rude, spending her many lives in a sheltered environment led her to be incredibly prim, proper, and blissfully unaware that others were not given the same upbringing.
<br><br>
<b>Attire</b><br>
Here comes that term "prim and proper" again. Her attire varies greatly based on the current situation of her surroundings, but is always incredibly modest. She fancies flat soles over heels, leggings or thick tights under short things like dresses and skirts, long button up dress shirts, and even suit-like jackets. The colors of her attire will widely vary based on her current situation and environment as well.

The Aeromancer
</div>

<div id="tab1">
<h1>Birth of a "Hero"</h1>
Many many years ago, in the ancient times of a world parallel to our own but very different, various magical trees were planted by two god-like and powerful beings. They were the epitomes, the core centers of the kinds of magic power they were planted to give in the first place, and from them the Elemental Guardians were born. Sky herself had her own body once upon a time, created by the same gods who planted these magical trees as a Guardian of its power, meant to protect it from those who would misuse it. She was one of many among her brethren, who were all handmade with bodies of their own, a collective that lived together in harmony and shared the same purpose in life.
<br><br>
While their people were still young and their tribes were still being established, a great war and a terrible tragedy wiped them all out. In order to make sure they could keep their protective vigil around their trees, their creators ordered their own "right hand man" so to speak--a powerful entity known commonly as The Wisp Queen--to allow their spirits to inhabit human host bodies and fuse with the host body soul, giving them eternal life in a sense and allowing them to "reincarnate" or pass on to another host after death. This strange tradition continued for generations until a harsh split formed between Tree Guardians, humans, and magical beasts in general. Due to racism and prejudice, as well as yet another war that had been brewing outside of their homelands, the Elementals agreed to keep watch in spirit but refused to continue their tradition of taking human hosts as outlets and living mediums for their own magic potential.
<br><br>
Another Elemental Guardian by the name of Topaz and her eternal lover, Onyx, did not agree with the segregation's existence whatsoever and fled their homelands to continue the old ways, finding themselves trapped instead in our modern human world. The success of their escape did not bode well for the Elders that governed this sect of Guardians, who were losing control of their own people as a strong rebellion blossomed. More and more were returning to their old habits, and although they would be caught and reprimanded as long as Onyx and Topaz remained successful the people would still act out against the system. In order to put an end to this, special clearance was provided to Sky, allowing her to possess the developing infant within an impregnated woman of her choosing to be born and raised among the humans. This was, of course, a very closely watched operation where the Air Elemental was only allowed to follow a very specific plan set out for her by her superiors, which demanded she devote her human host's life entirely to physical and magical training. Once her physique reached a point that satisfied them, she was released to study the magical arts and re-learn all the amazing spells she'd developed over her many lifetimes. 
<br><br>
Sky was sent to a mysterious establishment known as Ulreich University, where she continues to train, preparing for the day when she will fight the pair of lovers and destroy their hosts, bringing them back home in shackles. Every criminal must be served justice, this is a mission she does not take lightly.

<div id="tab3">
<h1>Their Ways of Life</h1>
<b>Political Power</b><br>
"The Elders" are a group of Elemental Guardians appointed by their creators at their "births" to lead their people. They form a sort of Council, one from each Element, that represent their own specific tree, holding meetings and voting on actions much like a Congress. These leaders are only changed if they die or are convicted of crime, and their replacements are always appointed by their gods.
<br><br>
<b>The Agenda</b><br>
Due to the cruelty of absorbing the soul of a human host and taking their place entirely, the Elders have gone to the opposite extreme and done everything in their power to ban their people from taking hosts at all. They push overwheling propoganda and punishment, forcing the views of their people to change in order to match their own. Now taking on a host is considered dirty despite all its benefits, and is only allowed for very specific reasons and cases.
<br><br>
<b>Vows</b><br>
As eternal and ageless spirits, their vow-based laws have been made incredibly strict, especially those surrounding marriage. While a typical vow or promise that is not upheld is met with humiliation and torture, the breaking of marital vows in any way (especially adultery) counts as high treason and is ended in death. Promises and word-binds are not taken lightly in the slightest, and marriage is not encouraged unless one is absolutely certain they wish to spend their lives with their chosen partner.
<br><br>
<b>Social Hierarchy</b><br>
Elemental Guardians do not rely on money whatsoever, instead their social classes are divided by seniority. The longer a spirit has existed, the "wealthier" and higher praise they receive. This also accounts for their brethren who live on in memory rather than actual life. As long as the people remember a fallen one of their own, their hypothetical "life" continues on. The longer they have been alive and remembered, the more respected and treasured their past existence is considered.
<br><br>
<b>Gender</b><br>
As body-less spirits, they possess no true gender stereotypes or social standards. Elementals can identify as they please (no matter what genitalia their birth bodies possessed) freely without experiencing any unfair advantages or disadantages alike. Gender is considered unimportant until the need or desire for reproduction arises, in which a female is given more attention and care as she carries the offspring to term.

</div>

<div id="tab5">
<h1>Items</h1>
<b>Suitcase</b><br>
A medium sized hard-cover suitcase carrying all her essentials, from typical feminine things like make-up and hair care products, to necessities like clothing and shoes.
<br><br>
<b>Backpack</b><br>
A small book bag with shoulder straps that holds a few scrolls from her home and a journal. Intended more for using on potential long trips away from Campus, small enough not to slow her down but big enough to hold a change of clothing and some food or water if needed.
<br><br>
<h1>Weapons</h1>
<b>Tessen</b><br>
<img align="right" style="width:40%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/2BqTIcM.png"/>
A traditional Asian-style fan that is made of iron rather than soft felts or wood, with a very sharp bladed edge arching over the top. It folds neatly just like any other hand-held fan, although this one in particular has a special "secret." In addition to being used as a "conduit" for Sky to cast her spells through, this particular tessen has a special secret: its thick girth can snap in half to become two separate and thinner versions of itself (Aluminum grade) or remain in its normal singular attached-together mode (Iron grade).

</div>

<div id="tab7">
<h1>Elemental Guardian Racials</h1>
<b>Eternal Life</b><br>
Unless actively killed or destroyed, the Elementals can live on and on. They do not age nor can they die from natural causes, including nonmagic poisons, toxins, etc. They feel no hunger or thirst, and are technically wandering undead souls. It is possible for them to die, most certainly, but only by the hands of fellow mages. 
<br><br>
<b>Host Possession and Fusion</b><br>
As spirits themselves, the Elementals can inhabit the same space in living beings that their own souls inhabit, assuming those living beings have souls of course. Their influence on their host is very minimal, and while they cannot have complete control they can act like a voice of conscious, quietly whispering in the mind to encourage some things or discourage others. Until the souls actually fuse together, their influence lies entirely in the power of suggestion.
<br>
Speaking of fusion! Once a host pushes beyond the rank of High Mage and embarks on a rank path, their soul and the Elemental spirit will completely fuse, and the two separate entities will become one singular one in its entirety. Sometimes this may alter the personality of the mage entirely, and other times it does not. Achieving this feat unlocks all memories and knowledge the Elemental possesses to be accessed freely by the host body at will. Fusion most often causes the host to change their name to that of the Elemental's and fully represent them since they quite literally become one with them. While it is possible to completely fuse the souls of the Elemental and its host at birth, this can only be done in special circumstances with other Elementals influencing the nature of the possession. It is considered very controversial, as in that case the host would never be able to develop its own personality, and the child would be born with only the Elemental's personality and memories.
<br>
If the Elemental spirit is destroyed before the host, either the host will lose all magic ability permanently or die themselves (depending on cause of death). 
<br><br>
<b>Chains of a Mortal Coil</b><br>
Once a host body has been chosen, it cannot be abandoned or left (unless forcibly removed by powerful magic) until that host body dies. Every time a host passes away and a new one must be chosen, the spirit must start from the beginning and rise up through the ranks all over again. (Death of the character means that IF the replacement character slot is taken by the another host of the same Elemental Spirit, they MUST start over at Paige and work their way up.) 
<br><br>
<b>Natural Weakness</b><br>
Magics specifically designed to target the soul are effective against Elementals. Because their souls are not as fragile as their host souls, in order to protect the host from a premature death they act like a sort of shield and take the brunt of the soul-based damage. This makes them vulnerable to offensive Necromancy or Spiritualism based magic. (15% vulnerability) 
<br><br>
<b>Visibility</b><br>
An Elemental Spirit cannot be detected by those who can see or communicate with spirits just with base racials, a spirit sensory spell of at least Mage rank is required to be able to detect their presence within their hosts at all.
<br><br>
<h1>Elemental Host Racials</h1>
<b>Increased Dexterity</b><br>
Her quite literal "dexterity" and physical balance, is twice as capable and efficient as that of the average human's. (x2)
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced Flexibility</b><br>
Years of gymnastic training have rewarded Sky with the ability to contort her body as much as a professional contortionist.
<br><br>
<b>Increased Speed</b><br>
Both her mental processing/perceiving speeds and her physical speeds are twice as fast as the average human's. (x2)
<br><br>
<b>"Aero" Resistance</b><br>
Sky's own Aeromancy is slightly more effective and resistant against airborn chemicals, gasses, and even liquids if in smaller amounts, than what would be considered typical. +(25%)
<br><br>
<b>Icy Weakness</b><br>
On the opposite side of the spectrum, her particular choice of magic is slightly less effective and resistant against ice constructs. -(25%)
<br><br>
<b>Flight!</b><br>
While it is certainly strange, every Aeromancer Guardian's host through history has been given the gift of natural flight, without wings or any visible source. Legend says the Air Elementals are so lighthearted and high-spirited it gains physical manifestation when combined with human capacities for passion and emotion, and is given life.
<br>
Flight is a term used loosely, however, as the ability cannot allow the host body to hover higher than twenty feet above the ground. While they can seemingly glide through the air with ease, they will always make a gradual descent until reaching the ground again. They gain no benefit or experience no physical movement loss while "flying" and thus remain at their own base stat (which is x2 speed for this race).

<div id="tab9">
<h1>Mana Manipulation; Universal Spells</h1>
<i>"The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level. (Most spells taught in class are under this tree. Spells taught in class must be on your character sheet, and any alterations or upgrades to taught spells must be discussed with a professor.)"</i>
<br><br>
<b>Natural Aura</b><br>
The natural aura that emits from her whenever she utilizes her mana pool and activates a spell is not considered "normal." While most mages emit a color or something similar that wraps harmlessly around their own bodies, Sky's possesses no visual aesthetic. Instead, she emits a very slight and harmless puff of air from her body that can only be truly felt when standing in close proximity to her.
<br><br>
<b>Mana Weave</b><br>
The simple act of moving one's mana pool through their own body. Channeling one's mana. 
<br><br>
<b>Mana Spark</b><br>
A basic mana projectile that can be used offensively or defensively. It causes no real damage other than a small sting when hit directly in the flesh.

<div id="tab11">
<h1>Elementalism; Aeromancy (Paige)</h1>
<i>"Often seen as the most primal or basic form of magic, Elementalists tap into one of six different elements to produce their magic. Each possesses a different mana type, and may use their spells to generate their chosen element. Aeromancy is the control over wind, and sometimes other gasses/smoke."</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Crescent Slice</b><br>
A five foot long and one foot thick crescent-shaped gust of wind (which can be vertical or horizontal) capable of cutting through tin grade materials or constructs (scales naturally to Iron at Mage). It travels as slow as a ball being tossed under-hand, and is only able to move ten feet away from the caster before dissipating.
<br><br>
<b>Fortitude: Knight's Shield</b><br>
The caster compresses air in a singular direction of their choosing, creating an "invisible" circular air pocket (not intentionally hidden just hidden to the naked eye) that curves outward, like Gladiator shields in myths and legend. This air pocket can be up to five feet tall and five feet wide, and is as durable as tin (scales naturally to Iron at Mage rank).
<br><br>
<b>Quality and Clarity</b><br>
This spell allows the caster to extend their mental faculties to the air around them for a good ten feet, letting them pick up on any natural toxins and harmful substances, or magical ones so long as they're not being intentionally hidden by spells of equal or higher rank (naturally scales to Mage) within their radius of effect.
